3. Enter your move using the grid positions:
   # T1, T2, T3 → Top row (Left, Middle, Right)
   # M1, M2, M3 → Middle row (Left, Middle, Right)
   # B1, B2, B3 → Bottom row (Left, Middle, Right)
4. The AI will make its move after yours.
5. The game will continue until:
   # A player wins (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal).
   # The board is full (resulting in a draw).
   # At the end of the game, you will be asked if you want to play again.

Running the game:

Needs Python 3.X installed on your pc
Run python TicTac/main.py or python3 TicTac/main.py

Possible future improvements:
Implement a GUI
Make an ai that actually thinks instead of picking at random
Add a scoreboard and replayability
